# Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Data-
The course presents the theoretical and algorithmic basis of the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the introduction of data mining. AI is primarily engaged in the creation of computer programs with the ability to simulate human activity. For example: software that can play games, design active strategies, and solve queries and complex problems. The purpose of the course is to focus on designing "smart software". DataMining is the activation of algorithms for the discovery and analysis of information that exists in databases. It is a relatively young field of computer science and is characterized by work that combines knowledge from different fields
