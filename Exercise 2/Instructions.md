1.	Modify the data structure to keep the total number of states stored in the structure and the maximum number of states stored simultaneously in the structure.

2.	Run search (3) and search (4), what is your conclusion?

3.	Change the heuristic function to return the number of tiles out of place.


4.	Run search (3) and search (4) again, what is your conclusion?

5.	Change the heuristic function to return the Manhattan distance of the tiles from their target position.


6.	Run search (3) and search (4) again, what is your conclusion?
